# Would You Rather Project
This project is developed using React.js, Redux, React Router and 
the many packages that help these libraries play nice.
The game is transpiled to ES5 for legacy browser compatibility.

## Getting Started

You will need to have yarn install, although node equivalent will work
just as well.

Pull this repository
```
git clone <repo_url>
```

```
yarn install
yarn start
```
Then the application will be running on

```
http://localhost:3000/
```

* Select one user from the 3 choices and login.
* Start Playing.

play and render this project.

Mobile devices are not supported at this time.
